# EmergencyResponseSimulator
ðŸš¨ Project Description: Emergency Response Simulation This project simulates an emergency response system where various types of emergency units (such as Police, Firefighters, Ambulances, Hazmat teams, and Cyber Units) respond to incidents in a city. The incidents range from crimes, fires, medical emergencies, chemical hazards, and cyber threats. Each unit has specific capabilities to handle different types of incidents, and their response effectiveness is influenced by factors like speed, availability, and the difficulty of the incident. The simulation incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model the system. The program generates random incidents and calculates a score based on how quickly and effectively the units respond. The final score reflects the unit's speed, the difficulty of the incident, and any penalties for unhandled situations. Key Features: â€¢	Multiple unit types (Police, Firefighters, Ambulance, Hazmat, Cyber Unit) â€¢	Incident types (Crime, Fire, Medical, Chemical, Cyber) â€¢	Dynamic scoring system based on response time and incident difficulty â€¢	Round-based simulation with random incidents generated each round
